## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub.
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```
3. **Add the upstream repository** as a remote:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-owner/your-repo.git
   ```
4. **Create a feature branch** for your work:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Development Setup

To prepare your local environment:

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Install Git hooks** (required for Conventional Commits checks):
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg
   ```

These hooks will automatically validate your commits against the Conventional Commits specification before they are committed.

## Conventional Commits

This project strictly adheres to the **[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)** specification for all commit messages. This standard helps us maintain a clear, structured commit history and enables automated semantic versioning.

### Commit Format

All commits must follow this format:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Commit Types

- **feat**: A new feature (triggers a minor version bump)
- **fix**: A bug fix (triggers a patch version bump)
- **docs**: Documentation-only changes
- **style**: Changes that don't affect code meaning (formatting, whitespace, etc.)
- **refactor**: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
- **perf**: Code changes that improve performance
- **test**: Adding or updating tests
- **ci**: Changes to CI/CD configuration
- **chore**: Changes to build process, dependencies, or tooling
- **revert**: Revert a previous commit

### Examples

**Simple bug fix:**
```
fix: correct typo in README
```

**New feature with scope:**
```
feat(docker): add multi-stage build optimization

Improves image size by 40% and reduces build time.
```

**Bug fix with body and footer:**
```
fix(auth): prevent credential leak on logout

Ensure all session tokens are cleared from memory
when user logs out, preventing unauthorized access.

Closes #123
```

**Breaking change (triggers major version bump):**
```
feat!: redesign configuration system

BREAKING CHANGE: The config file format has changed from YAML to JSON.
See migration guide: https://example.com/migration
```

**Feature with scope and breaking change:**
```
feat(api)!: replace REST endpoints with GraphQL

BREAKING CHANGE: All REST endpoints are deprecated in favor of the new GraphQL API.
Refer to the migration guide for details.
```

### Tips

- Keep the subject line under 50 characters
- Use the imperative mood ("add" not "added")
- Don't capitalize the first letter
- Do not end with a period
- Use the body to explain *what* and *why*, not *how*
- Reference related issues and PRs in footers

## Making Changes

1. **Keep commits atomic** â€“ each commit should represent one logical unit of work.
2. **Write clear commit messages** following the Conventional Commits format (see above).
3. **Write tests** â€“ add or update tests for any code changes:
   - New features must include tests demonstrating they work
   - Bug fixes should include a test that catches the original issue
   - Aim for reasonable test coverage
4. **Test your changes locally** before pushing â€“ ensure all tests pass.
5. **Write documentation**:
   - Add docstrings/comments to functions and classes
   - Update README or docs if behavior changes affect users
6. **Keep code clean** â€“ follow language conventions and best practices (see [Code Style & Best Practices](#code-style--best-practices)).

## Submitting Pull Requests

1. **Ensure your branch is up to date**:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

2. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub:
   - Provide a clear, descriptive title
   - Link any related issues (e.g., "Closes #456")
   - Describe the changes you've made and why

4. **Respond to feedback** â€“ we may ask for changes or clarifications.

### PR Requirements

- All commits must follow the Conventional Commits specification
- Automated checks must pass (linting, tests, etc.)
- At least one review approval is required before merging

## Code Style & Best Practices

**Follow your language's conventions** â€“ whether Python (PEP 8), JavaScript (ESLint), Go (gofmt), or others.

### General Guidelines

- **Use meaningful names** for variables, functions, and classes
- **Add comments** for complex logic and non-obvious decisions
- **Keep functions focused** â€“ each should do one thing well
- **Write tests** for all new features and bug fixes (see [Making Changes](#making-changes))
- **Document your code**:
  - Add docstrings/comments to public functions and classes
  - Update README or relevant docs if your changes affect users
  - Include inline comments for tricky logic
- **Keep it DRY** â€“ don't repeat yourself; extract common patterns into reusable functions

## Questions or Issues?

- **Found a bug?** Open an issue.
- **Have a question?** Feel free to start a discussion.
- **Want to suggest a feature?** Open a feature request issue.
